# AZ-400: Define and implement continuous integration (20-25%)

## Design an application infrastructure management strategy
- Assess a configuration management mechanism for application infrastructure
- Define and enforce desired state configuration for environments

## Implement a build strategy
- Design and implement build agent infrastructure
    - cost
    - tool selection
    - licenses
    - maintainability
- Develop and implement build trigger rules
- Develop build pipelines
- Design build orchestration (products that are composed of multiple builds)
- Integrate configuration into build process
- Develop complex build scenarios
    - containerized agents
    - hybrid
    - GPU

## Maintain build strategy
- Monitor pipeline health
    - failure rate
    - duration
    - flaky tests
- Optimize build
    - cost
    - time
    - performance
    - reliability
- Analyze CI load to determine build agent configuration and capacity

## Design a process for standardizing builds across organization
- Manage self-hosted build agents
    - VM templates
    - containerization
- Create reuseable build subsystems
    - YAML templates
    - Task Groups
    - Variable Groups
